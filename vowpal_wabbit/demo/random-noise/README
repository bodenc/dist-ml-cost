Demo of vowpal wabbit's ability to separate signal from noise.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
--------------

    All the components below must be present and located somewhere
    in your $PATH in order to run the demo.

    1) A reasonable Unix-like env, with standard utilities including:

            GNU less
            GNU diff
            bash
            perl
            GNU make (not needed if you run 'vw-demo' directly)

    2) The following executables (from your vw distribution):

            vw
            vw-varinfo

    3) The following are used to estimate 'goodness' of model
       and create density & correlation charts:

            R
            ggplot2 (R library. Can be installed from within R
                     see http://ggplot2.org/)


Main idea of this demo:
-----------------------

As long as noise is random, it cannot bias a model.  If it was
biased, and could affect the model we're building - it would't be
called "noise."

    The linear expression used in the demo is:

        y = a + 2b - 5c + 7

    (It is a parameter you can actually pass to the main script to
    change the default).

    Each demo sequence consists of the following steps:

        Generate a random train set in which the label y is a perfect
        linear combination (a + 2b - 5c + 7) of the input features.

        Generate a model from this random train-set.

        Generate a _separate_ train-set using the same linear
        combination formula, but with a different random seed.
        so the two sets are completely different, even though they
        are based on the same formula (and model.)

        Train a model on the train set.

        Test the model on the test-set, while ignoring the existing labels.

        The predicted results should equal the actual test set labels.

The demo has 3 parts:
---------------------
    1) Ideal conditions.  No noise added.

    2) Global noise in the range [-1, 1] added to the continuous label
       y in the train-set.

    3) Per input-feature noise of +/-50% of each variable range
       is added to the train set. This affects the label in a
       3-modal dispersed way (as shown in a chart produced by the demo)

The noise is generated using the standard perl 'rand' function,
roughly simulating a uniform distribution, using a simple
pseudo-random number generator.

We demonstrate that despite the noise, the (almost) perfect model
is being learned in each of the 3 parts of the demo.

In fact, the small imprecisions in the model are due to us
deliberately limiting the precision of the data sets to 6-digits
after the decimal point (for brevity and readability purposes).
You may change this by passing '-p N' where N is different than 6
to the 'random-poly' script.

The whole demo is scripted.
---------------------------

All you need to do is:

    1) call './vw-demo' (or type 'make') from the shell
    2) Hit Enter (repeatedly) to go to the next step
       In cases the pager (less) is called, you need
       to hit 'q' to exit the pager.
